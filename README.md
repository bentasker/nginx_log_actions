nginx_log_actions
=================


NGinx Log Actions is a small processing script designed to read in an NGinx access log and perform custom actions on a per domain basis. It was written as an accompaniement to the article [Keeping Hitcounts accurate when using an NGinx Caching Proxy](http://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/linux/253-keeping-hitcounts-accurate-when-using-an-nginx-caching-proxy).

It's fairly basic and not necessarily as efficient as it could be, but is pretty effective.
